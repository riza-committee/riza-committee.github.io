- make 0net (via zeronet-conserancy) fully user-moderated
- add safe api functions to 0net via plugin (using any TT language suitable for prototype)
- split zeronet-conservancy into network-relay and obsolete ui stuff
- develop storage-agnostic highlevel db read-write api
- make 0net or riza (depending on progress) available entirely through browser
- add more details to roadmap
- *don't* throw the can further down the road
