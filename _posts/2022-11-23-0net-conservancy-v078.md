not all plans go accordingly. as a matter of fact, most don't. so did
the plan to build riza quickly from scratch. however, the project is
not abandoned and step by step crawls the [roadmap](/roadmap).

<cut/>

one of this steps is zeronet-conservancy v0.7.8 which, while still not
addressing the biggest 0net issue (user identity & spam protection),
we still deemed it a necessary step to sustain 0net as useable
network, further protect its users and prepare for bigger changes.

in today's release changelog:

- use archived version of .bit domain registry to avoid malicious rewrites
- readdress .bit domains as part of their deprecation
- remove potential vulnerability via setuptools (@ajesse11x)
- improve copying peers from sidebar
- reduce fingerprinting information available to unprivileged sites
- improve starting script
- fix default ssl version to be secure
- disable geoip-related ip address leak when in tor-only mode
- windows os build/running instruction (WIP)
- better command line parsing
- ArchLinux AUR package
- update android instruction (thanks oseido for reporting)
- better browser launch handling
- ability to add/remove from favourites from sidebar
- NoNewSites plugin
- show help message even when startup fails
- fix plugin options handling regression
- multiple code improvements

is that a lot? is that a little? really, neither. what we need is a
dedicated team to work on both sustaining zeronet-conservancy, making
it fully decentralized and revolutionizing api â€” the main step towards
riza

that said, today we're just happy to celebrate v0.7.8 and invite you
to celebrate with us!
