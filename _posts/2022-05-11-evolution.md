there haven't been a lot of public activity on `riza` lately and we'll
discuss that in a later, perhaps more personal post, but now let me update
you on one core insight that we've reached through this silent period.
it's really quite simple and perhaps could even be tied to dao or aikido
principles, however let me not get carried away with metaphors too much.

<cut/>

whenever possible, guide the evolution into desired direction rather than
swim against the stream or run up the downstream elevator. in this case,
not only (as we mentioned somewhere on community) we prefer evolution to
decide what is the best approach to fighting challenges, but also consider
that we may better achieve our goals by gradually reshaping 0net into
`riza`, without losing neither data nor all of the userbase. this will
also provide time to test out solutions which do and don't work and let
`riza` be well tested from its official start.

with this in mind, we're currently concentrating on resolving immediate
0net issues (such as reliance on centralized and controlled by potentially
compromised creator of the network) while also preparing grounds for
merging `riza` features into zeronet-conservancy.
