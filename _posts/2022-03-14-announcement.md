last three weeks mark the beginning of a new historic period — where we can no
longer close our eyes and have to bear witness to how lack of access to
information can lead directly to mass murder (colloquially called "war"). free
uncensored speech is not a luxury, but an imperative for peaceful prosperous
life and overall survival of humanity.

thus we cannot postpone any longer and today we announce the development of
censorship-resistant, all-restriction-immune, privacy-protecting peer to peer
worldwide network that will be accessible to everyone. of course, this is not
enough to stop or prevent war, but it is a prerequisite.

<cut/>

by now, there are a few existing p2p solutions which also share some of our
goals, but they all so far fall short of delivering them in full. [ipfs][ipfs]
only specializes in storing files; [beaker browser][beaker] binds network and
browser thus limiting user's software choices tightly; [0net][0net] is drowning
in attempts to become user-friendly, while unfortunately failing to address some
core centralization issues.

there have been a few attempts at building dweb on blockchain, but while
blockchain is a useful technology (and *we will incorporate it as a part* of our
network, e.g. as a source of timestamps), solely blockchain-based projects are
doomed to fail to be truly decentralized because as we know by definition
blockchain is based on consensus that is emerging online — something that cannot
be achieved when the network is fractured, for instance, by government and
corporate censorship, or let's say even space (imagine networking on mars).

furthermore, a network of the future needs to finally put the user back in
control of the data flow: what information is downloaded, stored and uploaded
should be a conscious choice instead of following directives of the site
"owners" or browser “rules”. to avoid those completely preventable privacy
exposures / leaks we would need apps and sites to be fully transparent, open and
in computational proof that they do what they declare they do.

as early computer networks lacked in speed and scale, they also used to be more
decentralised than today's internet, which later changed in order to pull
resources together and allow history to take its course; today there is no more
need to keep compromising; thanks to technological advancement, we can build
open, decentralized, free network for everyone. [stay tuned for the updates and
join us][riza].
