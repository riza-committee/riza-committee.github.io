i'm often asked why riza will be a better network and here is a biased comparison to prove it!

. | riza | 0net | regular web
--|------|------|------------
status | early development | ready to use, but only in maintanence development in forks | ubiquitous
programming language | agda + js — one robust sound theory-based language + js for browser api connection, third-party code is protected by strong types | python + js (+ sql + json dsl) — two dynamic loosely typed languages, not properly separated from third-party code | virtually any
runs on | both full featured node and browser-only light client | only python-supported platforms | depending on site, can be browser-dependent or be easily parsable or give out api
network | network-agnostic, can be connected via range of options from webrtc or post pigeon usb-stick delivery | torrent-based with tor and local network peer discovery support, though manual update via copying is also technically possible | with rare exceptions, requires central internet online presence for viewing pages beyond single session
cross-network integration | can use third-party data sources as well as provide network data to specialized apps/sites | very limited | depends on site
censorship resistance | users can easily keep all transaction history, preventing from losing information due to forced deletion/editing; protocols for steganography and anonimizing data; optional timestamping via various methods | tor for anonimity; deleting private keys to avoid further data modification | sites can be taken down via traffic filtering, dns or server attacks; modifications can be made without anyone noticing (unless someone is specifically tracking particular page)
privacy protection | native riza apps/pages are completely transparent in their data exchange, aleviating user from having to trust privacy policies | locking cross-site communication and advising to block third-party sources | a lot of data is knowingly given on trust in privacy policy basis, other data is routingly collected unannounced; third-party extensions preventing some of it can limit site functionality and/or circumvented
susceptability to private key being lost or compromised | possibility to add, revoke and mark keys related to one account; no data loss due to key holder deciding to delete something | manual backup & limited multi-sig capability | not applicable, most sites have direct access to your data
multi-device | one can use different keys on different devices, only cross-confirmation is required | one can either use manual key copying or use different keys without connecting accounts | depends on site, most use password or other weak data/identity protection so multi-device experience is usually smooth
